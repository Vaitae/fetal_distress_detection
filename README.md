# Fetal Distress Detection

This repository contains the file related to my final year bachelor's project. The project focuses on analyzing the CTU-CHB Intrapartum Cardiotocography (CTG) dataset for predictive modeling.

## Content

### 1. `Fetal_Distress_Detection.ipynb`
- **Description**: Jupyter Notebook that contains all the source code for the project. This includes data preprocessing, analysis, and model implementation.

### 2. [`ctu-chb-intrapartum-cardiotocography-database-1.0.0`](https://physionet.org/content/ctu-uhb-ctgdb/1.0.0/)
- **Description**: This contains the link to full PhysioNet CTU-CHB Intrapartum Cardiotocography (CTG) dataset which is used for this project. The dataset consists of CTG signals used to predict intrapartum fetal conditions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, etc.
